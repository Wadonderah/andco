## Technical Implementation

### Rate Limiting Strategy

All services implement rate limiting to stay within free API quotas:

```dart
// Google Maps API: 2,500 requests/day
setRateLimitConfig(const RateLimitConfig(
  maxRequestsPerMinute: 4,
  maxRequestsPerHour: 100,
  maxRequestsPerDay: 2500,
));

// Hugging Face API: 1,000 requests/month
setRateLimitConfig(const RateLimitConfig(
  maxRequestsPerMinute: 2,
  maxRequestsPerHour: 30,
  maxRequestsPerDay: 100,
));
```

### Caching Strategy

Intelligent caching reduces API calls and improves performance:

```dart
setCacheConfig(const CacheConfig(
  enabled: true,
  cacheDuration: Duration(minutes: 30),
  maxCacheSize: 50,
  persistCache: true,
));
```

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

Each service implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Services continue operating with reduced functionality
2. **Fallback Responses**: Pre-defined responses when AI services are unavailable
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
4. **User Notifications**: Clear error messages and alternative actions

### Data Privacy and Security

- **Local Processing**: Maximum data processing on-device
- **Data Anonymization**: Personal data anonymized before API calls
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted using flutter_secure_storage
- **GDPR Compliance**: User consent management and data retention policies

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Firebase Integration

- **Authentication**: Role-based access control for AI features
- **Firestore**: Storage for AI training data and configurations

### API Key Management

API keys are managed securely:

```dart
// Environment-specific configuration
class ApiKeys {
  static const String googleMapsApiKey = String.fromEnvironment('GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY');
  static const String openWeatherApiKey = String.fromEnvironment('OPENWEATHER_API_KEY');
  static const String huggingFaceApiKey = String.fromEnvironment('HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY');
}
```
